Compiling SIBuilder
===================

Source code is available from https://github.com/ddab-archive/sibuilder. The
source code for the final release can be found by switching to the v3.4.2-FINAL
tag.

The source code for each application and library is provided in separate 
directories. Shared code is provided in its own directory. Each application, 
library and the custom components have their own build script, named Build.bat. 
These scripts each support several build options.

The Delphi 7 command line compiler is required to build the main Pascal source 
code. Delphi 4 can optionally be used to build some programs and libraries. 
The code may compile correctly with later non-Unicode versions of Delphi with 
some tweaks to the build scripts. Significant changes may be needed to compile 
with Unicode versions of Delphi.

In addition to Delphi, the following build tools are required:

* VIEd – DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor. Used to compile version 
  information .rc files from the related .vi. files. There is one such file for 
  each application and library and one for the custom components package.
  
* BRCC32 – Borland Resource Compiler, supplied with Delphi. Used to build .res 
  files from .rc files, including the .rc files generated by VIEd.
  
* HHC – Microsoft HTML Help Compiler. Used to create the help file 
  SIBuilder.chm.

* SIBuilder itself – to build the SIBuilder installer!

If the resource and version information files are not modified then the Pascal 
code can be rebuilt from the Delphi IDE. Binary versions of the resource and 
version information files for release 3.4.2 are supplied as .res files in the
sibuilder-src-3.4.2-FINAL.zip file available from the GitHub repo's Releases
page.

The custom components included in the download must be compiled and installed 
before building SIBuilder.exe.

The following environment variables are needed by the build scripts:

* DELPHI4 must be set to the install directory of Delphi 4 if this compiler is 
  to be used. Leave unset to use Delphi 7 to compile everything.

* DELPHI7 must be set to the install directory of Delphi 7.

* DELPHIDABLIBD7 must be set to the install directory of the required 
  DelphiDabbler components on Delphi 7 (see below).

If different versions of Delphi are to be used either the purpose of these 
environment variables must be subverted or the build scripts will need to be 
modified.

In order to compile SIBuilder some additional DelphiDabbler library components 
are required. These components are not included with the main source code but 
must be downloaded separately from GitHub.

* Version Information Component: 
  https://github.com/ddablib/verinfo
  
* Shell Folders Unit:
  https://github.com/ddablib/shellfolders
  
* Window State Components:
  https://github.com/ddablib/wdwstate
  
* Drop Files Components:
  https://github.com/ddablib/dropfiles
  
* Clipboard Viewer Component:
  https://github.com/ddablib/cbview
  
* Stream Extension Classes:
  https://github.com/ddablib/streams
  
The components must be installed into the Delphi IDE before compiling SIBuilder.
