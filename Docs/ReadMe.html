	Description
</h2>

<p>
	<em>SIBuilder</em> (Small Installation program Builder) is a software
	installation program creator that creates a stand alone executable software
	installer with little overhead taken up by the installer. This makes the
	program ideal for creating a single, self-extracting installation program
	for distribution over the Internet. <em>SIBuilder</em> is part of the SI
	Tools suite of programs and libraries. The other programs in the suite are
	either used to perform the installation and uninstallation of projects
	created with <em>SIBuilder</em> or are extra, bonus, programs.
</p>

<p>
	To keep down the overhead required for the Installer and the optional
	uninstall program <em>SIBuilder</em> creates these programs as Windows
	console applications.
</p>

<p>
	The user specifies the files to be installed which are compressed before
	being compiled into the installer. Different installation folders can be
	specified for various groups of files. The registry can be updated with the
	required keys and data. The installer can run one or more external programs
	after the files have been copied and the installation completed. The install
	program can be configured to run differently on specified operating
	systems.
</p>

<p>
	An uninstall program can optionally be created and installed. If this is
	done the installed program appears in Control Panel's &quot;Add/Remove
	progams&quot; applet and the installed program can be uninstalled from
	there. The un-installer optionally deletes files and folders that were
	installed and can tidy up the registry. It can also run other programs
	(before any deletion or registry tidying) and may unregister COM servers
	registered by the install program.
</p>

<p>
	A license dialog box that can be displayed and the user can be required to
	accept the license before installation begins.
</p>

<p>
	Applications and DLLs can be registered with Windows, as can COM server
	DLLs.
</p>

<p>
	A small console application that can create shortcuts (shell links) is
	provided. This program can be executed as part of an installation to create
	the required shortcuts. The same program can be used by the un-installer to
	remove the shortcuts.
</p>

<p>
	Information needed to create an installation project is entered using a
	wizard style interface. Project information can be stored in and read from
	<code>.sip</code> project files.
</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">
	Compatibility
</h2>

<p>
	<em>SIBuilder</em> has been tested with Windows XP Pro and Window Vista Home
	Premium. It is believed to operate on the Windows 9x and NT platforms from
	NT4. From version 3.4.1 the program and the installers operate on Windows
	Vista.
</p>

<p>
	The various programs require different privilege levels on NT platform OSs
	as the following table shows:
<p>

<table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="2">
	<tr>
		<th style="width:20%;">
			Program
		</th>
		<th style="width:40%;">
			Windows NT, 2000 and XP
		</th>
		<th style="width:40%;">
			Windows Vista
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			<em>SIBuilder</em>
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			Operates normally, with standard user privileges.

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			Generated installers and <em>UnInstall</em>
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			The install and uninstall programs usually need to be run with power
			user or administrator privileges since they need access to protected
			areas of the file system and registry. Installations may fail if run
			at the wrong privilege level.
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			These programs will request to be run as administrator and also
			require elevation. Starting the programs from a standard user
			account will require an admin password.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			<em>Shortcutter</em>
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			Operates correctly when run from the installer, providing the
			installer has the correct privileges. The program may fail when run
			stand-alone as a standard user if used to create shortcuts in
			protected areas of the file system.
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			Operates at the privilege level of the invoking program. This works
			fine from the installer. The program may fail when run stand-alone
			as a standard user if used to create shortcuts in protected areas of
			the file system. It will not request an enhanced privilege level in
			this case.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			<em>RegInprocSvr</em>
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			Must be run with admin privileges in order to register COM servers
			in the registry. Registration fails when run as a standard user.
		</td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">
			Requests admin privileges and elevation when run. Starting the
			program from a standard user account will require an admin password.

<h2 id="installation">
	Installation and Removal
</h2>

<h3>
	Installation
</h3>

<p>
	<em>SIBuilder</em> is provided in a self-extracting install program &ndash;
	<code> SIB3Inst.exe</code>. The installation program is a console
	application that executes in a terminal window. <em>SIBuilder</em> was in
	fact used to create its own installation program &ndash; so if the
	installation succeeds you know that <em>SIBuilder</em> works!
	<code>SIB3Inst.exe</code> may be distributed within a zip file, along with
	this file. If this is the case, unzip the <code>.zip</code> file and then
	execute <code>SIB3Inst.exe</code>.
</p>

<p>
	To install the program simply navigate in Explorer to where you downloaded
	or extracted <code>SIB3Inst.exe</code> and double click the file.
</p>

<div class="pullout">
	<div>
		<strong>Windows Vista</strong>: You will be asked to confirm the
		operation and may need to provide an administrator password.
	</div>
	<div>
		<strong>Windows NT, 2000, XP</strong>: You need to ensure you have
		administrator privileges. You will not be warned. The installation will
		simply fail.
	</div>
</div>
	
<p>
	The installer will open a console and will display its welcome message
	before pausing for you to enter an installation path. Either press return to
	accept the suggested path or enter the required path and press return. The
	license agreement will then be displayed. Click the <em>Accept</em> button
	to continue. Clicking <em>Decline</em> will abort the installation.
</p>

<p>
	By default <em>SIBuilder</em> is installed into the
	<code>DelphiDabbler\SIBulder3</code> sub-folder of your Program Files
	folder, and most files are installed there  or in sub-folders. Some files
	are also installed in a <code>DelphiDabbler</code> sub-folder of the
	system's Common Files folder. Details of installed files are provided in
	<code>File Manifest.txt</code> which is installed in the <code>Docs</code>
	sub-folder. 
</p>

<p>
	<em>SIBuilder</em> stores its configuration information in two registry
	keys:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Fixed application configuration information is stored in sub-keys under
		<code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\DelphiDabbler\SITools\3.0\SIBuilder</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		User configurable settings are stored on a per-user basis in sub-keys
		under
		<code>HKCU\Software\DelphiDabbler\SITools\3.0\SIBuilder</code>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	A shortcut to <em>SIBuilder</em> is created on the desktop.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Note: </strong>The installation program will uninstall any previous
	SIBuilder 3 versions before proceeding with the installation of this
	version.
</p>

<h3>Removal</h3>

<p>
	To uninstall <em>SIBuilder</em> use Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs
	applet.
</p>

<div class="pullout">
	<div>
		<strong>Windows Vista</strong>: You will be asked to confirm the
		operation and may need to provide an administrator password.
	</div>
	<div>
		<strong>Windows NT, 2000, XP</strong>: You need to ensure you have
		administrator privileges. You will not be warned. The uninstallation
		will simply fail.
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	To take care of uninstallation on behalf of Add/Remove programs
	<code>SIB3Inst.exe</code> installs a console based uninstall program
	(<code>UnInstall.exe</code>) into the root installation folder
	(<code>DelphiDabbler\SIBuilder3</code> in the Program Files folder by
	default). This program requires a data file &ndash;
	<code>UnInstall.xml</code> and a DLL &ndash; <code>InstallLib.dll</code>
	&ndash; which are also installed in the same location. Care should be taken
	not to move or delete these files as they are required by Add/Remove
	programs.
</p>

<p>
	<code>UnInstall.exe</code> deletes most files, the desktop shortcut, and
	cleans the registry. However, <code>UnInstall.exe</code> can't delete itself
	or <code>InstallLib.dll</code>. Once <em>SIBuilder</em> has been uninstalled
	it is safe to manually delete these files <code>along with </code>the
	installation folder.
</p>

<div class="pullout">
	SIBuilder stores default project information in a sub-folder of the user's
	application data directory. The uninstaller does not remove this data. It
	can be safely removed manually.
</div>
