> ***This project is archived and is no longer being developed. No support is available. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are not being accepted.***

For more information about the program please see the [SIBuilder](https://delphidabbler.com/sib) page on [delphidabbler.com](https://delphidabbler.com).

For more information about using the program see `Docs/Tutorial.pdf` or the help file that is installed with SIBuilder.

## Final Release

The final release of the program is [v3.4.2](https://github.com/ddab-archive/sibuilder/releases/tag/v3.4.2-FINAL).

## Source Code

The source code, from the first to last release, was never developed under any form of version control.

This repository is based on the source code of the final release with the changes listed below. The source code as it was at the final release can be viewed by switching to the [v3.4.2-FINAL](https://github.com/ddab-archive/sibuilder/tree/v3.4.2-FINAL) tag.

### Commits since final release

The `main` branch of this project differs from the final release in the following ways:

1. This `README.md` file has been added for display by GitHub.
2. `Docs/Tutorial.pdf` has been added. This file existed as a separate download to the main program, but was not included in the source tree until now.
3. `Docs/Build.txt` has been added. This file outlines how to build the SIBuilder source code.
4. `CHANGELOG.txt` has been added. This file summarises changes in each release.

## History of Changes

The original source tree did not have a centralised change log. Instead changes for each project were summarised in the `.phf` text files that can be found in the `Docs/Updates` directory.

In addition, each source code file has its changes noted in header comments.

As noted above, `CHANGELOG.txt` was not added until this repository was created.

## License

The executable code is covered by the EULA described in `Docs/SIBuilder.lic`.

Much of the source code released under the [Mozilla Public License v1.1](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/).
