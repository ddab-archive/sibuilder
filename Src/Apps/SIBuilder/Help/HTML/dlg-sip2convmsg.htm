	<h1>
		SIBuilder 2 File Conversion Results Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		When a <span class="file">SIBuilder</span> v2 file is opened adjustments
		may be made to the project before it is loaded into the program because
		of incompatibilities between v2 and the current release. The main
		changes are in the way that license files are handled, the handling of
		in-process COM servers registration and in how programs that are to be
		run by the installer can be flagged for deletion after use.
	</p>

	<p>
		When adjustments are made to a project, details are displayed in this
		dialog box. Multiple adjustments can be displayed. 
	</p>

	<p>
		To the right of the details of each adjustment a <span class="ui">More
		info</span>
		<a href="def-hottext.htm">hotlink</a>
		is displayed. Clicking the link displays a help topic that contains
		further information about the adjustment. If no further information is
		available the link is disabled.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is possible that the user will wish to modify some of the adjustments
		made. To facilitate this, the dialog box is displayed non-modally. It
		stays on top by default, but can be set to display normally by clearing
		the <span class="ui">Stay on top</span> checkbox. The dialog is
		<em>not</em> updated with details of any manual changes.
