		v2 File Conversion Comment:<br>
		License Dialog DLL Removed from Project
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> uses a DLL &ndash;
		<span class="file">SITLicenseDlg.dll</span> &ndash; to display any
		license required by the installer. <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span>
		deletes the DLL once the license has been displayed, while
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> stores the DLL in the installation
		folder and only (optionally) deletes it with the uninstaller.
	</p>

	<p>
		The current case is one where the DLL would have been deleted by the
		uninstaller under <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span>. However, it is
		assumed that the current project does not need the dialog DLL since the
		license file itself was flagged for deletion by the installer once it
		had been displayed. Therefore <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> has
		not taken any steps to retain the DLL after it has been used to display
		the license. 
	</p>

	<p>
		If it is known that the DLL is required by the project then the DLL
		should be added to the project either into an existing
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
		or into a newly created one. Use the 
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>
		to make these changes.</p>
	
	<p>
		<span class="file">SITLicenseDlg.dll</span> forms part of the core
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> installation and may freely be
		copied and distributed with your application.
