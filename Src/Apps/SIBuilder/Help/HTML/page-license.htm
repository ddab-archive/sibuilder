	<h1>
		License Information Page
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		This page is used to define which, if any license is displayed by the
		installer.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a license is to be displayed a special DLL required by the installer
		to display the license is automatically included in the installation.
		The user must provide the license file to that is to be displayed. The
		installer deletes both the license and the DLL once the license has been
		shown. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If the
		<a href="licensefile.htm">license file</a>
		is also to be used by the program being installed it must be explicitly
		added to the project on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>.
		Developers are free to use the license DLL with their programs &ndash;
		again the DLL needs to be explicitly added to the project in such cases.
		In either case no additional overhead is incurred since each file is
		included only once in the install program, regardless of the number of
		copies to be installed.
	</p>

	<p>
		The license page is divided into four main areas. Each of the key areas
		is described below. 
	</p>

	<h2>
		Display License Check Box
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Check the <span class="ui">Display license</span> check box if a license
		is to be displayed by the installer. If this check box is clear then the
		remainder of the page is disabled and there is no more to do. If the box
		is checked then, at a mimimum, a license file must be provided.
	</p>

	<h2>
		License File Group Box
	</h2>

	<p>
		Information about the license file to be displayed is entered here.
		Enter the source license file name and path in the
		<span class="ui">Source license file</span> edit box, or click the
		button embedded in the edit box to display the
		<a href="dlg-browselicense.htm">Browse for License File</a>
		standard windows dialog and use that to find the license file. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The license file can be dragged and dropped onto the group box from
		Explorer.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Dialog Box Properties Group Box
	</h2>

	<p>
		In this group box the characteristics of the license dialog box are
		defined.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <span class="ui">Which buttons</span> drop-down list allows you to
		choose the buttons that are displayed as follows:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="spaced">
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Accept and Decline:</span> two buttons are
			displayed and the user is required to accept the license before
			proceeding with the installation. Should the user decline then the
			installation is halted.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Close only:</span> a single button is displayed and
			installation simply continues when the dialog box is closed.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The dialog box can be displayed in one of three sizes &ndash; small,
		medium and large. Choose the required size from the
		<span class="ui">Dialog size</span> drop-down list.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Test Group Box
	</h2>

	<p>
		Click the <span class="ui">Display License</span> button to display the
		<a href="dlg-testlicense.htm">Test License</a>
		dialog box according to the defined properties. If no license file has
		been selected, or the chosen file doesn't exist a message to this effect
		is displayed in the dialog box.
	</p>

	<p>
		The license dialog box displays a <span class="ui">Help</span> button to
		enable you to get further information about the dialog box. This button
		will not appear when the dialog box is displayed by the installer. The
		buttons requested in the Which buttons drop down list are displayed but
		serve only to close the dialog box.
	</p>
