	<h1>
		Edit Group Properties Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This dialog box is displayed when the <span class="ui">Add Group</span>
		or <span class="ui">Edit Group</span> buttons on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>
		are clicked. It is used to either define the properties of a new file
		group or to edit the properties of an existing
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The various group properties that can be edited are explained below.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Name of Group
	</h2>

	<p>
		The name of the group is entered in the <span class="ui">Group
		name</span> edit box. This name must be unique.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Installation Path
	</h2>

	<p>
		The path where the files in this group are to be installed are entered
		in the <span class="ui">Installation path</span> combo box. These paths
		can include
		<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">path macros</a>,
		which can be selected from the combo box's drop down list. Alternatively
		the folder can be chosen from the
		<a href="dlg-folder.htm">Choose Folder</a>
		dialog box by clicking the <span class="ui">Browse for folder</span>
		entry in the combo box. The folder selected is entered in the combo box
		and can be edited.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Deletion Options
	</h2>

	<p>
		The various options for deleting the group or its files are specified in
		the <span class="ui">Folders</span> and <span class="ui">Files</span>
		radio button groups.
	</p>

	<p>
		The options for deletion of folder are:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="unspaced">
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Do not remove folder</span> &ndash; the folder is
			never deleted.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Remove folder if empty</span> &ndash; folder is
			removed by the uninstaller only if it contains no files or sub
			folders.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Remove folder and all contents</span> &ndash; the
			uninstaller forcibly removes the folder and all its files and sub
			folders.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Similarly the choices available for deletion of files in the group are:
	</p>

	<ul class="unspaced">
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Do not delete files</span> &nbsp; these files are
			never deleted.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Delete only files that were installed</span>
			&ndash; only files installed by the installer are deleted by the
			uninstaller - any other files are left intact.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Delete all files in folder</span> &ndash; all files
			in the folder, regardless of whether they were installed by the
			installer, are deleted by the uninstaller.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Temporary files deleted by installer</span> &ndash;
			once the files have been used by the installer it deletes them (e.g.
			use this option for a program and/or file to be run by the installer
			on installation only).
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If you have chosen to remove the folder and its contents the
		<span class="ui">Files</span> radio buttons are disabled and the 
		<span class="ui">delete all files</span> option is implied. If any of
		the Windows, System, Program Files or Common Files folders are specified
		then it is not permitted to remove the folder or delete all files.
		If the group's install folder is a special system folder then several
		deletion operations are not permitted.
	</p>

	<p>
		For further information about file and folder removal options see the
		<a href="def-groups.htm">File Groups</a> help topic.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Operating System Options
	</h2>

	<p>
		Each group can be set so that it installs only on certain operating
		systems. This enables different files to be installed on different
		operating systems. The selected operating systems for this group are
		listed in the <span class="ui">Operating system options</span> group
		box. The supported operating systems can be edited using the
		<a href="dlg-osoptions.htm">Operating System Options</a>
		dialog box which is accessed using the <span class="ui">Select
		Options</span> button.
