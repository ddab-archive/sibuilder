	<h1>
		Choose Registry Template Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This dialog box appears when the <span class="ui">Templates</span>
		button is clicked on the
		<a href="page-registry.htm">Registry page</a>.
		It is used to select one of the pre-defined
		<a href="def-regtemplates.htm">registry templates</a>
		and to assign values to the registry &quot;macros&quot; or placeholders
		within the template.
	</p>

	<p>
		The keys contained in the chosen template are then added to the registry
		tree on the registry page. New keys created in this way will be deleted
		by the uninstaller only if the keys are empty.
	</p>

	<p>
		All available templates are listed in the <span class="ui">Choose
		template</span> drop down list. When the required template is selected
		from the list it is displayed in the dialog. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The template can be accepted as-is, or, if it contains
		<a href="regtpltmacros.htm">registry template macros</a>
		it can be customised by providing values for the macros. Macros appear
		as blue hotlinks in the template. A description of the macro will be
		provided as a tool tip if the mouse cursor is paused over the
		<a href="def-hottext.htm">hotlink</a>.
	</p> 

	<p>
		The macro can be given a new value by clicking the hotlink. A popup menu
		will be displayed which contains a list of previous values assigned to
		the macro, the macro name itself and a <span class="ui">New Value</span>
		option. Selecting one of the values or the macro name will cause it to
		replace the current macro value. Clicking <span class="ui">New
		Value</span> will display the
		<a href="dlg-newregmacrovalue.htm">New Registry Macro Value</a>
		dialog box where a new value can be entered. The template will be
		updated to display the new value. When the template has the required
		values click <span class="ui">OK</span> to update the registry tree.
	</p>

	<p>
		The current values associated with any macro can be edited by clicking
		the <span class="ui">Edit Macro Values</span> button and making the
		required changes in the
		<a href="dlg-editregmacro.htm">Edit Registry Template Macros</a>
		dialog box.
