		About Compression Systems
	</h1>

	<p>
		By default <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> provides two different
		compression libraries that can be used to compress the files. In
		addition it is possible to specify that no compression is to used.
	</p>

	<p>
		The default compression system is ZLib and the alternate system is
		BZip2. Each of these compression systems has advantages and
		disadvantages. It is recommended that projects are built using both
		compressors and the resulting install program sizes are compared.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> enables new compression systems to
		be added to the program by third parties.
