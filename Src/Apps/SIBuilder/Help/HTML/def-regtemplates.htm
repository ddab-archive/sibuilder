		About Registry Templates
	</h1>

	<p>
		Registry templates are designed to make it easy to enter commonly used
		registry keys in the project's registry tree.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each template provides a registry path. Some of these paths are fixed
		registry keys (e.g. the &quot;run once&quot; key in
		<span class="file">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</span>).
		However other keys have variable parts to them, such as the key used to
		associate an extension with a file type or application
		<span class="file">KEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ext</span>) where the extension
		<span class="file">.ext</span> needs to be replaced by the required
		value every time the key is used. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Registry templates contain &quot;macros&quot; wherever a such variable
		item occurs in a key. These act as placeholders for the required value.
		Macros are enclosed in brackets like this: <kbd>[MacroName]</kbd>. So
		the template for associating an extension with a file type or
		application is recorded as
		<span class="file">KEY_CLASSES_ROOT\[FileExt]</span>. When a template is
		used each macro can be replaced by a value &ndash; and the macro
		remembers its recent values and its current value. Most of the
		predefined templates use macros.
	</p>

	<p>
		When a template is presented to the user the most recent value for each
		macro (if any) is used. The
		<a href="dlg-chooseregtplt.htm">Choose Registry Template</a>
		dialog lets the user replace the value with any recent value or provide
		a new one. When a template is added to the registry the most recently
		used value is subsituted for each macro.
	</p>
