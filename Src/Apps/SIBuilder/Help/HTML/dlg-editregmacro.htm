		This dialog box is used to edit the lists of values associated with
		<a href="regtpltmacros.htm">registry template macros</a>.

		button in the
		<a href="dlg-chooseregtplt.htm">Choose Registry Template</a>
		dialog box is clicked.
	</p>

	<p>
		The macro whose values are to be edited is selected in the
		<span class="ui">Select macro</span> drop down list. The values
		associated with the macro are displayed in the
		<span class="ui">Value</span> list box. To add a new value enter it in
		the <span class="ui">Value</span> edit box and click the
		<span class="ui">Add</span> button. To edit an existing value either
		double click it or select it in the list box and click the
		<span class="ui">Edit</span> button. The value is then copied to the
		edit box. Change the value as required then click the
		<span class="ui">Update</span> button. Values can be deleted
		individually by selecting them and clicking the
		<span class="ui">Delete</span> button. All the values can be deleted
		using the <span class="ui">Clear</span> button.
