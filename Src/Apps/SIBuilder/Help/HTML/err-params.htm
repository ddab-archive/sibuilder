		Parameters Error
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> has detected one or more problems
		with the parameters associated with the current program. The parameters
		causing the problem are marked with a
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:16px;vertical-align:middle;"
			alt="bomb symbol"
		> symbol.
	</p>

	<p>
		The associated program is to be run by the uninstaller while the
		parameter references a file that is included in a temporary
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
		&ndash; which will not be available to the uninstaller. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<em>Solutions:</em>
	</p>

	<ol class="unspaced lower-alpha no-para-space">
		<li>
			Change the program to run only from the installer (use the
			<span class="ui">Execute on</span> drop down list to select
			<span class="ui">Installation only</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			Cancel this dialog and use the
			<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a> to make sure the parameter
			file is not deleted by the installer.
		</li>
		<li>
			Edit the parameter to refer to a non-temporary file.
