		v2 File Conversion Comment:</br>
		License Dialog DLL Added to Project
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> uses a DLL &ndash;
		<span class="file">SITLicenseDlg.dll</span> &ndash; to display any
		license required by the installer. <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span>
		deletes the DLL once the license has been displayed, while
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> stores the DLL in the installation
		folder and only (optionally) deletes it with the uninstaller.
	</p>

	<p>
		The current case is one where the DLL would have been deleted by the
		uninstaller under <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span>. It is not clear
		whether the current project requires the dialog DLL for its own use, but
		since the license file has been retained, it is possible. Therefore
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> has created a new
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
		&ndash; &quot;SIP2 CONVERTER: License DLL&quot; &ndash; containing the
		license DLL. The group has been flagged for deletion by the uninstaller.
	</p>

	<p>
		If it is known that the DLL is not used by the project then the DLL (and
		its group) can safely be deleted from the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>.
	</p>
