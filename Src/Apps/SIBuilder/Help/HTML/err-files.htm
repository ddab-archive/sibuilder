		File Errors

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> has detected one or more problems
		on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>. The offending files are marked
		with the
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:16px;vertical-align:middle;"
			alt="bomb symbol"
		> symbol in the tree view. The likely causes of the problems, and
		possible solutions, are listed below:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="spaced lower-roman">
		<li>
			<div>
				The source for the given file does not exist on the host system.
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<em>Solution:</em> The entry should be deleted and possibly
				replaced with the correct path to the file.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				The file is flagged as a shared DLL but the project does not
				permit uninstallation of pre-existing programs in the same
				folder. This is problematic since overwriting an existing
				project may cause a previously counted shared DLL to be
				overwritten without its usage count being decreased. This will
				cause the count to get out if sync with the number of programs
				actually using the DLL.
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<em>Solutions:</em>
				<ol class="unspaced lower-alpha no-para-space">
					<li>
						edit the file to remove the <span class="ui">Shared
						DLL</span> flag;
					</li>
					<li>
						go to the
						<a href="page-details.htm">Project Details page</a>
						and check the <span class="ui">Uninstall previous
						installations in same folder</span> check box.
