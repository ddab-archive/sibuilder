	<h1>
		v2 File Conversion Comment:<br>
		Program Moved to Temporary Install Group
	</h1>

	<p>
		Programs specified to be run by the installer under
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> could be set to be deleted after
		execution. These were the only files the the installer was able to
		delete (other than the license file), so, for example, any documents
		displayed by the program had to remain on the system. The programs to be
		deleted were specified on the
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs page</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		With <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> the facility has been
		extended so that the installer can now delete any installed file. To
		acheive this the files to be deleted are included in a new deletable 
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a> on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>.
		This means that programs themselves are no longer marked as deletable.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When loading a <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> project file that
		specifies an installed program for deletion we need to use the new
		method to ensure they are actually deleted. This is done by creating a
		special deletable group to install the program file from and moving it
		to there from its original group.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Note 1:</strong> if the program accesses any other files
		(possibly specified as command line parameters) and those files are not
		required elsewhere in the installed program then the user may wish to
		also move those files to a temporary group. Such files are not moved
		automatically by <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> since there is no
		way of knowing if the files are needed elsewhere.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Note 2:</strong> For security reasons
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> no longer allows external programs
		(i.e. those not included on the install project) to be deleted after
		being run.
	</p>
