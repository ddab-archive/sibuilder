	<h1>
		Extra Program 1: RegInprocSvr
	</h1>

	<p>
		This program enables the user to register and unregister in-process COM
		server DLLs via a Windows interface. It is a windowed equivalent of the
		Windows <span class="prog">RegSvr32</span> command line application.
	</p>

	<p>
		To run the program simply double-click it in the
		<span class="file">Extras</span> folder.
	</p>
	
	<div class="callout para-space">
		<span class="smallcaps">Note:</span> If running on
		<span class="prog">Windows Vista</span> an elevation prompt may appear
		and an administrator password may be required.
	</div>
		
	<p>
		Enter the full file name
		of the DLL to be registered or unregistered (or drag and drop it from
		explorer) then click either the <span class="ui">Register</span> or
		<span class="ui">Unregister</span> buttons as required. If the
		registration or unregistration is successful then a confirmation message
		appears at the bottom of the window, otherwise an error message is
		displayed.
	</p>

	<div class="callout para-space">
		<span class="smallcaps">Note:</span> Should the DLL fail to register on
		<span class="prog">Windows NT</span>, <span class="prog">2000</span> or
		<span class="prog">XP</span> you should check you have sufficient
		privileges to register a COM server. If not, log on as an administrator.
	</div>
	
	<p>
		The program requires <span class="file">RegCOMSvrs.dll</span>, itself a
		COM server. This file is located in the same folder as the program and
		is registered when <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> is installed.
	</p>
