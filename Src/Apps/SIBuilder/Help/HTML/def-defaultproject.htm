		About the Default Project
	</h1>

	<p>
		The default project is loaded automatically when the program starts
		(unless another file is passed on the command line) or when the
		<span class="menuref">File | New Default</span> menu option is selected.
	</p>

	<p>
		Any loaded project can be specified as the default project by choosing
		the <span class="menuref">File | Make Default</span> menu option. The
		default project can be cleared using the <span class="menuref">File |
		Clear Default</span> menu option.
