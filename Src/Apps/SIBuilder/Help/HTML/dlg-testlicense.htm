	<h1>
		Test License Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This dialog box shows what the license dialog box that will be displayed
		by the installer will look like. It is displayed by clicking the
		<span class="ui">Display License</span> button on the
		<a href="page-license.htm">License Information page</a>,
		where its appearance has been configured. The only difference between
		this dialog box and the one that will be displayed by the installer is
		that this version has a help button and the one created by the installer
		does not.
	</p>

	<p>
		The dialog box is user-configurable using the License Information page.
		The configurable properties are:
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">License&nbsp;file</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				If no
				<a href="licensefile.htm">license file</a> has been specified
				then a message is displayed to that effect.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Span</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Small, medium and large sizes can be specified.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;buttons</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Either a single <span class="ui">Close</span> button is
				displayed or a pair of <span class="ui">Accept</span> and 
				<span class="ui">Decline</span> buttons are displayed. In the
				first case the installer simply displays the dialog box and
				continues when it is closed, while in the latter case
				installation only proceeds if the <span class="ui">Accept</span>
				button is clicked.

		</tr>
