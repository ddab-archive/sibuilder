	<h1>
		Files Page
	</h1>

	<p>
		The files page is where files to be installed are assembled. Files are
		collected together in
		<a href="def-groups.htm">Groups</a>.
	</p> 

	<p>
		The page contains a tree view of the project's files &ndash; groups are
		represented by folder icons and the name of the group is displayed.
		Files contained within groups are displayed under groups. Each file is
		represented by an icon according to its type along with the full path to
		the source file.
	</p>

	<p>
		By default a blank project comes with just one predefined group &ndash; 
		&quot;Main&quot;. This group will install files into the installation
		folder specified on the
		<a href="page-details.htm">Project Details page</a>.
		The &quot;Main&quot; group can be changed or deleted as required.
	</p>

	<p>
		Groups are updated by using the buttons on the right of the page, or by
		the equivalent items on group tree view's popup menu. The following
		commands are available:
	</p>
	
	<table cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Add&nbsp;Group</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Adds a new group. The
				<a href="dlg-editgroup.htm">Edit Group Properties</a>
				dialog box is displayed where the details of the new group can
				be entered. 
				<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">Path macros</a>
				can be included in the group's installation path.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Edit&nbsp;Group</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Edits the selected group, again using the
				<a href="dlg-editgroup.htm">Edit Group Properties</a>
				dialog box.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Delete&nbsp;Group</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Deletes the selected group, after seeking confirmation.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Add&nbsp;Files</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Adds one or more files to the currently selected group. Displays
				the
				<a href="dlg-addfiles.htm">Add Files</a>
				dialog box in which multiple files can be selected. The files
				added have default properties assigned to them (see
				<span class="ui">Edit File</span> below). The properties can be
				changed by editing the file.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Edit&nbsp;File</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Edits the file's installation properties using the
				<a href="dlg-editfile.htm">Edit File Install Properties</a>
				dialog box. The options which can be configured are those for
				overwriting existing files and whether file is registered in the
				Windows registry.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Remove&nbsp;File</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Removes the currently selected file from the group without
				prompting.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">File&nbsp;Properties</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Displays the
				<a href="dlg-fileproperties.htm">File Properties</a>
				dialog box which shows modification date, file attributes,
				modification date and size, along with any version information.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		Files can also be added to a group by dragging and dropping files from
		explorer and dropping them over a group in the tree view. If no group is
		under the cursor when the files are dropped a message is displayed to
		say the drop has been unsuccessful. <strong>Note:</strong> Dropping any
		file outside the treeview causes SIBuilder to attempt to open it as a
		project file.
	</p>

	<p>
		An empty folder can be created as part of the installation (say a folder
		for a users work files). To do this create a group that contains no
		files.
	</p>

	<p>
		When a file or group is selected a
		<a href="def-infopopups.htm">pop-up information window</a>
		may appear that displays key information about the selected item. These
		pop-up windows can be prevented from appearing using the
		<a href="dlg-options.htm">Options</a>
		dialog box.
	</p>

	<p>
		If there are any problems with any of the files on the page then its
		icon is replaced by a
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="vertical-align:bottom;width:16px;height:16px;"
			alt="bomb image"
		>
		symbol and a clickable prompt appears under the page's buttons which
		leads to help on what may be wrong.
	</p>
