	<h1>
		Target Operating System Page
	</h1>

	<p>
		The Target Operating System page is used to define the operating systems
		on which the installer will run. The installer will refuse to run on any
		operating system not included here.
	</p>

	<p>
		The page displays a heirachical list of operating systems: at the top
		level are the three Windows platforms: Win23s, Windows 9x and Windows
		NT. For the later platforms the various different products are listed at
		a second level, for example Windows 98 and Windows XP.
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the required operating system by check and unchecking the check
		boxes in the display &ndash; unchecking an operating system removes it
		from the supported list, while checking it adds it to the set of
		supported OSs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Checking and unchecking the OS platforms checks and unchecks all the
		associated products. If not all the products have the same state then
		the related platform's check mark is greyed.
	</p>

	<p>
		Details of the currently selected operating systems appear below the
		list.
	</p>

	<p>
		Click the <span class="ui">All OSs</span> button to select all OSs and
		platforms.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that it is not possible to leave this page if no operating systems
		are selected.
