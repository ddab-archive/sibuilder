	<h1>
		v2 File Conversion Comment:<br>
		License File Added to Project
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> always deletes license files after
		use. By default, <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> acted in the same
		way, but the user could specify that the file should be kept after use
		and be deleted by the uninstaller. The file would be installed in a
		user-defined folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is the case here, so <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> has
		created a new
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
		&ndash; &quot;SIP2 CONVERTER: License File&quot;
		which contains the license file and installs it to the appropriate
		folder, flagging it for deletion by the uninstaller.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this case the DLL used to display the license will also have been
		added to the project in the &quot;SIP2 CONVERTER: License DLL&quot;
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the license and/or the DLL are not required in the project, they can
		be deleted from the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a> by selecting the group(s)
		and clicking the <span class="ui">Delete Group</span> button.
	</p>
