		License Files
	</h1>

	<p>
		A license file takes the form of a plain ASCII text file that is created
		by the developer. The license is automatically included in the project
		and is displayed by the installer. By default, the license file is
		<strong>not</strong> installed onto the target computer.
	</p>

	<p>
		A license file can be dragged from Explorer and dropped on the
		<span class="ui">License File group box</span> in the
		<a href="page-license.htm">License Info page</a>, providing the
		<span class="ui">Display License</span> check box is checked. The
		license file can be <a href="licensetest.htm">previewed</a> in a sample
		dialog box.
	</p>

	<p>
		To permanently install a license file on the target computer ensure that
		the file is also included in a
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a> on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>.
