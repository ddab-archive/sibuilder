	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder Release 3</span> (<strong>S</strong>mall
		<strong>I</strong>nstallation program <strong>Builder</strong>) is an
		open source software installation program creator that creates a stand
		alone executable with little overhead taken up by the installer itself.
		This makes the program ideal for creating a single, self-extracting
		installation program for distribution over the Internet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To keep down the overhead required for the Installer and the optional
		uninstall program <span class="ui">SIBuilder</span> creates these
		programs as Windows console applications.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The user specifies the files to be installed which are compressed before
		being compiled into the installer. Main features are:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			The installation can be limited to certain operating systems.
		</li>
		<li>
			Different installation folders can be specified for various groups
			of files. These file groups can be customised for different
			operating systems.
		</li>
		<li>
			The registry can be updated with the required keys and data &ndash;
			with commonly used registry keys being accessed via templates.
		</li>
		<li>
			The installer can be configured to run further programs to customise
			installation.
		</li>
		<li>
			In-process COM servers can be registered. 
		</li>
		<li>
			A license dialog box can be displayed and the license accepted
			before the installation proceeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			An optional uninstall program be created and uninstallation
			triggered from Control Panel's &quot;Add/Remove progams&quot;
			applet.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Information needed to create an installation project is entered using a
		multi-page wizard-like interface. Project information can be stored in
		and read from <span class="file">.sip</span> project files.
