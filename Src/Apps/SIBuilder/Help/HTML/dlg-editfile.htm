	<h1>
		Edit File Install Properties Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This dialog box allows you to specify various actions to be taked when a
		file is installed on the target system. The dialog is displayed when the
		<span class="ui">Edit File</span> button on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a> is clicked.
	</p>

	<h2>
		File overwriting
	</h2>

	<p>
		The <span class="ui">File overwriting options</span> drop down list is
		used to choose what actions to take when a file with the same name
		already exists on the target system. The options are:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="unspaced">
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Always overwrite file with same name</span> &ndash;
			the file is always installed.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Never overwrite file with same name</span> &ndash;
			the file will not be installed if it already exists.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Only overwrite file with older time stamp</span>
			&ndash; the file will overwrite older files but will not replace
			newer files.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="ui">Only overwrite file with lower file version</span>
			&ndash; the file version numbers are compared and the file will
			overwrite existing files only if it has a higher version number.
			If the existing file has no version information it is overwritten.
			This option is only available for files containing version
			information.
		</li>
	</ul> 

	<h2>
		File registration
	</h2>

	<p>
		The controls in the <span class="ui">File registration</span> group box
		determine if and how the file is registered with Windows, as follows:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			If the <span class="ui">Register application path with
			Windows</span> check box is checked then the path of the installed
			file will be registered with Windows. Doing this enables an
			application to be started by simply providing its name without its
			path. A file does not have to be an application to be recorded here,
			but this may not make sense. The uninstaller de-registers any file
			registered under this option.
		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				Checking the <span class="ui">Register as shared DLL with
				Windows</span> check box causes the installer to check Windows'
				list of shared DLLs for the file. If the file is not present in
				the list it is added with a usage count of 1 while if it is
				present already the usage count is incremented. The uninstaller
				will decrement any existing count and will delete the file only
				if the count has reached zero. This option is only available if
				the file's group is set to delete only the files it installed.
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<strong>Note:</strong> When this option is used for any file it
				is important not to permit the user to repeatedly run the
				installer without first uninstalling the project or the file may
				never be deleted. The project's option to run the uninstaller
				prior to instalation should be enabled (see the
				<a href="page-details.htm">Project Details page</a> for more
				information).
			</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
</body>
