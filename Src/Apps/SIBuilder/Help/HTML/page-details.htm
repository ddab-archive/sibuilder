	<h1>
		Project Details Page
	</h1>

	<p>
		The project details page is where essential basic general information
		about the project is provided.
	</p>

	<p>
		This page should always be completed first when starting a new project
		&ndash; in fact starting a new project or opening an existing one always
		activates this page. It is not possible to leave the page until all
		required items have been provided.
	</p>

	<p>
		The page is split into four sections. The purpose and use of each
		section is described below.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Project Identification
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		The project ID identifies your project to
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> and must be provided. Enter a brief,
		unique, identifier for the project in the <span class="ui">Project
		ID</span> edit box. The ID must be a valid
		<a href="def-pascalidents.htm">Pascal identifier</a>.
		Examples of appropriate IDs include &quot;<kbd>MyProject</kbd>&quot;
		and &quot;<kbd>SIBuilder1</kbd>&quot;.
	</p>

	<p>
		A longer, descriptive, name for the project must also be provided. This
		name is used to identify the project to human readers, for example, by
		the Add/Remove programs Control Panel applet. This name is compulsory
		and should be entered in the <span class="ui">Project Name</span> edit
		box.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Installation Path
	</h2>

	<p>
		The Installation Path is the main (or root) folder on the target system
		in which the project is to be installed. A path can be entered either by
		typing it into the edit box or by clicking the button at the right end
		of the edit box and choosing a path from the
		<a href="dlg-folder.htm">Choose folder</a>
		dialog box that is then displayed. The installation path can contain any
		<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">path macro</a> except <kbd>[Install
		Files]</kbd>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Whether the installation path may be edited by the person installing the
		program is specified by checking or clearing the
		<span class="ui">Editing of installation path permitted?</span> check
		box. If this check box is checked then the <span class="ui">Ask user for
		path on installation?</span> check box becomes available. Checking it
		causes the install program to pause and ask the user to enter the
		required path. If this box is left clear then the only way for the user
		to change the installation path is to pass it as a command line
		parameter to the install program.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Install Program Info
	</h2>

	<p>
		The name to be used for the install file is entered in the
		<span class="ui">Install program name</span> edit box. This is
		<span class="file">Install.exe</span> by default. The install file is
		created in the same folder as the project file, so no path should be
		specified.
	</p>

	<p>
		Determine whether <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> will create an
		uninstall program by checking or clearing the <span class="ui">Create
		uninstall program?</span> check box. If created, the uninstall program is
		always named <span class="file">UnInstall.exe</span>.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Previous Installations
	</h2>

	<p>
		The installer can require other applications to be uninstalled before
		the installation continues. The identifiers of the programs to be
		uninstalled are entered in the <span class="ui">Uninstall
		projects(s)</span> edit box &ndash; multiple identifiers are separated
		by semi-colons. As an alternative a list of identifiers can be specified
		by clicking the <span class="ui">Edit</span> button embedded in the edit
		control and using the 
		<a href="dlg-uninstprojects.htm">Edit Projects to be Uninstalled</a>
		dialog box to enter the identifiers. The identifiers to specify are
		those that are used to identify a program to the WIndows Add/Remove
		programs control panel applet in the Windows registry.
	</p>

	<p>
		The install program can also detect if a previous
		(<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> generated) installation already
		exists in the folder it is being installed into. If this is the case the
		installer can uninstall the previous installation before performing its
		own installation. This is the default behaviour and is required by some
		project options. The installer can be prevented from uninstalling
		previous installations by clearing the <span class="ui">Uninstall
		previous installations</span> in same folder check box.
	</p>

	<p>
		When all entries have been made it is possible to move to other pages.
		If there any missing or invalid entries on this page then a message will
		be displayed and the page cannot be changed.
	</p>
