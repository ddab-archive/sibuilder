	<h1>
		New Delphi COM Server Application Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This dialog box appears when the <span class="ui">Delphi COM Apps</span>
		button is clicked on the
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs page</a>.
		It is used to supply the name of a local COM server application to be
		registered by the install program and un-registered by the uninstall
		program. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The dialog box presents a drop down list that contains details of all
		the 32 bit executable files in the current project. A program should be
		selected from this list.
	</p>

	<p>
		The selected program should support the Delphi standard for registering
		out-of-process COM servers: i.e. passing the
		<span class="switch">/regserver</span> switch on the command line should
		register the program and then exit while passing the
		<span class="switch">/unregserver</span> switch on the command line
		should unregister the server and exit.
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> cannot test for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		On pressing the <span class="ui">OK</span> button
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> will create two program entries on
		the
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs page</a>: one to register the
		server and the other to unregister it. If you wish to edit these entries
		you should do so by selecting the program and editing in the usual way.
		Should you not want the server to be un-registered by the uninstaller
		then select the entry with the <span class="switch">/unregserver</span>
		switch and delete it.
	</p>
