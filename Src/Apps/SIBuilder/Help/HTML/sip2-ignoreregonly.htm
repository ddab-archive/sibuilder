		v2 File Conversion Comment:<br>
		Ignored &quot;Register Only&quot; Property for COM Server
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> provided a &quot;register
		only&quot; property for in-process COM servers that enabled a COM server
		to be registered by the installer but ignored by the uninstaller. It was
		left to the user to ensure that the server wasn't deleted by the
		uninstaller!
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> does not support this property.
		This conversion comment indicates that such a property was encountered
		in the project file and has been ignored by
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span>. The uninstaller will automatically
		unregister any COM server that was registered by the program before
		deleting the file. If the file is not deleted then it is not
		unregistered. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The server file's entry on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>
		will show that the installer will register it as before.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is recommended that all In-process COM servers are flagged to be
		registered as shared DLLs as well as being registered as COM servers.
		This way the server will only be deleted once it is no longer required
		by programs. To do this select the file on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files page<a>
		and edit it using the <span class="ui">Edit File</span> button to
		display the
		<a href="dlg-editfile.htm">Edit Install File Properties</a> dialog box.
	</p>
