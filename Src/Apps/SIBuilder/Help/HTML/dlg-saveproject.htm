	<h1>
		Save Project Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This standard Windows dialog box is displayed when the
		<span class="menuref">File | Save As</span> menu option is selected (or
		<span class="menuref">File | Save</span> is selected for an un-named
		project). It can also displayed when an un-saved project is built.
	</p>

	<p>
		The dialog is used to provide a path and file name for a project file.
		Files with the <span class="file">.sip</span> extension should be
		specified. It is not possible to save to
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> v1 <span class="file">.sib</span>
		format files.
	</p>

	<p>
		If a chosen file already exists the user will be invited to confirm that
		the file can be overwritten.
