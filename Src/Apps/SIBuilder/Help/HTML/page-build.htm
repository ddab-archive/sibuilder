	<h1>
		Build Installer Page
	</h1>

	<p>
		This final page is used to build the install program using all
		information entered on the previous pages.
	</p>

	<p>
		Before the project is built the
		<a href="def-compression.htm">compression method</a>
		to be used compress the install files is selected using the
		<span class="ui">Compression</span> drop down list. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The project can be built by clicking the <span class="ui">Build</span>
		button. The page is then disabled and the build progress panel is raised
		up while the build takes place. The build, the progress of which is
		displayed on the raised panel, has several key stages:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="spaced">
		<li>
			If you have not saved your project then you will be asked to do so
			and the
			<a href="dlg-saveproject.htm">Save Project</a>
			dialog box will be displayed. If the project has already been saved
			it is re-saved to update the project file before building takes
			place. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The project is then verified to check for any errors, such as
			missing files.
		</li>
		<li>
			The data that will be embedded in the install program is then
			assembled and compressed as required. This is the longest phase of
			the build.
		</li>
		<li>
			The install program is finally created. The install file is given
			the name specified on the
			<a href="page-details.htm">Project Details page</a> and is stored in
			the same folder as the project file.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		If any errors are encountered a message is displayed identifying the
		error. If the project is successfully built then a confirmation message
		is displayed.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once the project has been saved a report of the files contained in the
		project can be produced. Generate the report, which is stored in the
		same folder as the project file, by clicking the
		<span class="ui">Report</span> button. The report is produced either in
		plain text or HTML, according to the settings made in the
		<a href="dlg-options.htm">Options</a>
		dialog box. The report can be viewed in your default text editor or
		browser (depending on type) by clicking the <span class="ui">View
		Report</span> button. 
	</p>

	<p>
		That's it! The install program is created and ready for distribution.
		However, you are advised to test the installation before distributing
		it. See
		<a href="install-progs.htm">Using Install and UnInstall</a>
		for further information.
