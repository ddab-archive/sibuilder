	<h1>
		v2 File Conversion Comment:<br>
		Ignored &nbsp;External&nbsp; In-Process COM Server
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> does not support registration and
		unregistration of COM server DLLs that are not included in the
		installation project. This facility was provided in
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, when <span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> encounters a
		section in a <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span> file that specifies
		registration of such a server, the entry has to be ignored.
	</p>

	<p>
		If it is important that a non-project COM server is registered then an
		external program can be developed to achieve this. Such a program can be
		included in the project and run by the installer (using the 
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs page</a>).
