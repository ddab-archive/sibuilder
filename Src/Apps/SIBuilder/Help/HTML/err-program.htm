	<h1>
		Program Error
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> has detected a problem with the
		program currently being edited. There are two possible reasons for this:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="spaced lower-roman">
		<li>
			<div>
				The program file is to be installed from a temporary
				<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
				(and will therefore be deleted by the installer), but it is
				flagged for running under the uninstaller.
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<em>Solutions:</em>
				<ol class="unspaced lower-alpha no-para-space">
					<li>
						change the value of the <span class="ui">Execute on drop
						down list</span> to <span class="ui">Installation
						only</span>;
					</li>
					<li>
						cancel this dialog box and install the program file into
						a different non-temporary 
						<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
						using the
						<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>.
					</li>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				The program is being run from the uninstaller but there is no
				uninstaller included in the project.
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<em>Solution:</em> cancel this dialog box and use the
				<a href="page-details.htm">Project Details page</a>
				to ensure an uninstall program that is included in the project.
			</div>
		</li>
	</ol>
