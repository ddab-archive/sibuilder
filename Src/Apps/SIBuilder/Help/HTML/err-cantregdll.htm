	<h1>
		Shared DLL Registration Error
	</h1>

	<p>
		It is an error for a file to be flagged as a shared DLL when the project
		does not permit uninstallation of pre-existing programs in the same
		folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is because overwriting an existing project without properly
		uninstalling it may cause a previously counted shared DLL to be
		overwritten without its usage count being decreased. This would cause
		the count to get out if sync with the number of programs actually using
		the DLL. 
	</p>
