		About Registry Template Macros
	</h1>

	<p>
		Registry template macros are placeholders within
		<a href="def-regtemplates.htm">registry templates</a>
		that can be edited to take required values. Each macro remembers the
		last value assigned to it and that value is used by default in all the
		registry templates that include the macro.
	</p>

	<p>
		The previous values that were used in the macro are also remembered so
		they can easily be restored by choosing them from a popup menu.
	</p>

	<p>
		The list of values associated with a macro can be edited using the
		<a href="dlg-editregmacro.htm">Edit Registry Template Macros</a> dialog
		box.
	</p>
