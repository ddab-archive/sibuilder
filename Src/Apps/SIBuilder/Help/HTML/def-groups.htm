	<h1>
		About File Groups
	</h1>

	<p>
		File groups are used to group files together that are to be installed
		according to the same set of rules.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A file group has the following attributes:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			A name &ndash; this is displayed by
			<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> and used to identify the group.
		</li>
		<li>
			An installation path &ndash; this is the path on which all files in
			the group will be installed.
		</li>
		<li>
			A rule governing how the folder is to be removed. This can be any
			of:
			<ul class="unspaced no-para-space">
				<li>
					the folder is never removed;
				</li>
				<li>
					the folder is only removed by the uninstaller if it is empty
					after files have been uninstalled;
				</li>
				<li>
					the folder and all its sub-folder and files will be removed
					(the file removal options are ignored) by the uninstaller.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			A rule by which the group's files will be deleted. This can be any
			of:
			<ul class="unspaced no-para-space">
				<li>
					all files in the folder will be deleted by the uninstaller;
				</li>
				<li>
					only those files that were installed in the folder will be
					deleted by the uninstaller;
				</li>
				<li>
					no files will be deleted;
				</li>
				<li>
					the files installed in the folder will be deleted by the
					installer (after they have been used) so these files are not
					available for use by the uninstaller &ndash; the option is
					designed for programs to be run from the installer.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			The set of operating systems under which the group will be
			installed. If the operating system on which the program is being
			installed is not in the set of those valid for the group then the
			group is not installed.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Therefore files must only be placed in the same group if:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="unspaced">
		<li>
			they are to be installed in the same folder;
		</li>
		<li>
			they are all to be treated identically when being uninstalled;
		</li>
		<li>
			they are all to be installed on the same set of operating systems.
		</li>
	</ul>
