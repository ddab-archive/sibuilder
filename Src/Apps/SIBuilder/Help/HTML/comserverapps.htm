	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> supports registration and
		unregistration of <span class="prog">Delphi</span> out-of-process COM
		server applications, or any other application that uses the
		<span class="switch">/regserver</span> and
		<span class="switch">/uregserver</span> command line switches to perform
		automatic registration without running the main application.
	</p>

	<p>
		To create entries for any <span class="prog">Delphi</span>
		out-of-process servers click the <span class="ui">Delphi COM Apps</span>
		button on the
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs page</a>.
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> does not perform any checks on these
		programs. The button is disabled if there are no 32 bit applications in
		the project.
