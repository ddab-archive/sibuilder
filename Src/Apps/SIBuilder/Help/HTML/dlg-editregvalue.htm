	<h1>
		Edit Registry Value Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This dialog box is displayed when the <span class="ui">Add Data
		Item</span> or <span class="ui">Edit Data Item</span> buttons from the
		<a href="page-registry.htm">Registry Page</a>
		are clicked. It is used to enter new values under registry keys or to
		edit existing values.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Name
	</h2>

	<p>
		The name of the data item is entered in the <span class="ui">Name</span>
		edit box. The data item's name must be unique for the key it belongs to.
		The empty string may be entered to denote the default data item for the
		key.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Data Type
	</h2>

	<p>
		The available types are <var>Integer</var>, <var>Binary</var>,
		<var>String</var> and <var>Expand String</var>. Choose the required type
		by selecting the appropriate radio button. If you choose one of the
		string types and require the installer to expand
		<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">path macros</a>
		then you should check the <span class="ui">Expand Path Macros</span>
		check box.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Value
	</h2>

	<p>
		The data item's value is entered in the <span class="ui">Value</span>
		text box. The format of the value must be appropriate for the data type
		selected in the <span class="ui">Data type</span> radio group. Permitted
		values are:
	</p>
	
	<table cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Integer:</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Enter a decimal whole number or a hexadecimal number preceded by
				a <kbd>$</kbd> symbol. The value must be such that it can be
				stored as a <var>Long Integer</var> or <var>DWORD</var>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Binary:</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				<div>
				 	Enter the binary data as space separated hexadecimal bytes.
				 	E.g. 
				 </div>
				 <div class="indent">
				 	<kbd>FF EE 4C 43 6A 00</kbd>
				 </div>
				 <div>
				 	represents six bytes of binary data.
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">String:</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Enter the string as simple text. Do not press return unless a
				CR LF pair is required in the string. If <span class="ui">Expand
				Path Macros</span> is checked then any
				<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">path macro</a> entered in the text
				box will be expanded when the installation program is run.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Expand String:</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Entry rules are the same as for
				<span class="label">string</span> above. The <var>expand
				string</var> type also support
				<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">path maco</a>
				expansion if required. An <var>expanded string</var> also
				contains unexpanded references to environment variables
				(delimited by <kbd>%</kbd> characters). See the Win 32
				programmers reference for further information. Do not embed path
				macros within environment variables as the behaviour is not
				defined.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>
		Alternative methods to enter values
	</h2>

	<p>
		If there is text data on the clipboard it can be pasted using the
		<span class="ui">Paste data from clipboard</span> button. The data is
		displayed in the <span class="ui">Value</span> text box and the
		<span class="ui">String</span> radio button will be selected. If there
		is no string data on the clipboard the <span class="ui">Paste data from
		clipboard</span> button is disabled.
	</p>

	<p>
		Binary data can be read from a file. To do this click the
		<span class="ui">Read data from file</span> button and choose the
		required file from the resulting
		<a href="dlg-openbindata.htm">Open Binary Data File</a>
		dialog box. The contents of the file will be displayed in Hex notation
		in the Value text box and the <span class="ui">Binary Data type</span>
		radio button will be selected. <strong>Note:</strong>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> does not permit files of more than
		2Kb to be stored in the registry.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the <span class="ui">String</span> or <span class="ui">Expanded
		String</span> radio buttons are selected then a file name can be
		inserted by clicking the <span class="ui">Insert File Name</span> button
		and choosing a file from the resulting
		<a href="dlg-insertfilename.htm">Insert File Name</a>
		dialog box.

	<p>
		If the <span class="ui">Expand Path Macros</span> check box is checked
		and either the <span class="ui">String</span> or
		<span class="ui">Expanded String</span> data types are selected then a
		<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">path macro</a> can be inserted at the
		current insertion point in the <span class="ui">Value</span> editor by
		clicking the <span class="ui">Insert Path Macro</span> button to drop
		down a menu of avaialable path macros and choosing the required macro
		from it.
