		What's New in SIBuilder 3
	</h1>

	<p>
		New features of SIBuilder release 3.x are:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			The program now natively creates install programs using its built in
			packager technology. This means <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span>
			is no longer dependent on <span class="prog">Borland Delphi</span>
			to compile its install programs. The &quot;old&quot; method of
			compiling with <span class="prog">Delphi</span>, was removed in
			release 3.3.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are now two different compression systems available for
			reducing the size of install files &ndash; and an extensible
			architecture means that additional compressor systems could be
			plugged in in the future. The install and uninstall programs now
			rely on a separate inflator DLL that is included in the install
			package to expand the install files and data. Despite requiring an
			additional DLL the total install program size has been reduced
			slightly.<br>
			<a href="def-compression.htm">More info</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Installation can now be made conditional on the target operating
			system. A set of valid operating systems can be defined for the
			whole project. The installer will refuse to run on any system that
			is not included. Additionally,
			<a href="def-groups.htm">file groups</a> can be individually
			configured to install only on certain operating systems. This means
			that different versions of files can be installed on different
			operating systems.
		</li>
		<li>
			Any existing installation in the same folder can now be properly
			uninstalled by the installer before proceeding with an installation.
		</li>
		<li>
			A facility to register applications with Windows has been added.
		</li>
		<li>
			There is now support for usage of counted shared DLLs. The installer
			increments the usage count of shared DLLs and the uninstaller
			decreases the count and deletes the DLL only if the count reaches
			zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			File version information can now be tested by the installer and used
			to determine whether a file should be overwritten. This is an
			alternative to testing the file age.
		</li>
		<li>
			Registry files that have been exported from the Windows registry
			editor can now be imported. This makes it easy to set the installer
			to update the registry for a program &ndash; the program's actual
			registry entries are simply exported from the registry and imported
			into <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span>, where any changes can be
			made. Registry files can also be exported.
		</li>
		<li>
			The generation of frequently used registry keys is eased by adding
			new predefined registry templates that can create the keys.
			The templates can be parameterized to enable parts of the key to be
			easily customised.<br>
			<a href="def-regtemplates.htm">More info</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			The uninstaller can now optionally delete empty registry keys.
		</li>
		<li>
			Build reports can now be produced either in HTML or in the new plain
			text format.
		</li>
		<li>
			The old tutorials were very out of date and have been removed, along
			with the sample files. A new online tutorial has been created in PDF
			format. This available from the <span class="menuref">Help | Online
			Tutorial</span> menu option.<br>

		</li>
		<li>
			Many enhancements have been applied to the user interface.<br>
