		v2 File Conversion Comment:<br>
		License DLL Registered a COM Server
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> uses a DLL &ndash
		<span class="file">SITLicenseDlg.dll</span> &ndash; to display any
		license required by the installer. <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span>
		enabled the user to require that the DLL was retained &ndash; ignored by
		the uninstaller &ndash; and registered as a COM server.
	</p>

	<p>
		This facility is not directly available in <span class="prog">SIBuilder
		3</span> so the project file has been modified to ensure that the DLL is
		separately installed and is flagged to be registered as a COM server.
		The program will have created a new
		<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>,
		&quot;SIP2 CONVERTER: License DLL&quot;, that can be viewed on the
		<a href="page-files.htm">Files Page</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder 3</span> provides alternatives that were
		not available in  <span class="prog">SIBuilder 2</span>. See the
		<a href="sip2-licdllretained.htm">License Dialog DLL Retained Without
		Deletion</a> topic for further information.
