	<h1>
		Edit Program Details Dialog Box
	</h1>


	<p>
		This dialog box enables the editing details of a program that is to be
		run by the installer, uninstaller or both. The dialog is displayed when
		either the <span class="ui">Add Program</span> or <span class="ui">Edit
		Program</span> button on the
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs Page</a> is clicked.
	</p>

	<p>
		The information to be entered is divided into two sections, with
		corresponding group boxes on the dialog: <span class="ui">Program
		Details</span> and <span class="ui">Command Line Parameters</span>. Each
		of these sections is discussed below.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Program Details
	</h2>

	<p>
		The <span class="ui">Program Details</span> group box is where the name
		of the program to be run is specified, along with when it is to be run
		and whether it should be deleted after execution. The controls are
		explained below.
	</p>

	<p>
		The program to be run is specified in the
		<span class="ui">Program</span> combo box. All executable programs
		currently included in the project are listed in the combo box's drop
		down list, so to choose an included program simply select it from the
		list. Alternatively an external program on the target system can be
		specified. To do this enter the program's full path on the target
		system.
		<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">Path macros</a> can be used and the
		combo box lists them in the drop down list to ease entry. An external
		program can also be chosen from the local computer by selecting the
		<span class="ui">Browse for file</span> item from the combo list and
		choosing the file from the resulting
		<a href="dlg-progfile.htm">Choose Program File</a>
		dialog box. Any standard paths in the chosen file are converted to path
		macros.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <span class="ui">Execute on</span> drop down list should be used to
		determine when the selected program is to be run. The options are:
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Installation&nbsp;only</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				The program is run by the installer after all files have been
				installed.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Uninstallation&nbsp;only</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				The program is run by the uninstaller before any files are
				deleted.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">
				Installation&nbsp;and&nbsp;Uninstallation</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				The program is run by the installer after installing files and
				by the uninstaller before deleting any files.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>
		Do not specifiy a program to be run by the uninstaller if either:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="unspaced">
		<li>
			the program is being installed by the installer in a temporary group
			(since the program will be deleted by the installer and therefore be
			unavailable to the uninstaller), or
		</li>
		<li>
			if no uninstall program is included in the project.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		If either of these mistakes are made then a message (preceeded by a
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:16px;vertical-align:bottom;"
			alt="bomb symbol"
		> symbol) will be displayed alongside the <span class="ui">Execute
		on</span> combo box. Click the message's
		<a href="def-hottext.htm">hot link</a> to read about possible causes of
		problems.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Command Line Parameters
	</h2>

	<p>
		The controls in this group box are used to enter details of the commands
		to pass to the program described in the <span class="ui">Program
		Details</span> group box. Each parameter or switch is entered separately
		and is displayed on its own line in the <span class="ui">All
		parameters</span> list box.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Zero or more command line parameters can be passed to the program.
		Parameters that contain spaces will be quoted before being passed to the
		program, so there is no need to include quotes.
		<a href="def-pathmacros.htm">Path macros</a> may be embedded in
		parameters and will be expanded by the installer. The parameters will be
		passed in the order they are specified.
	</p>

	<p>
		To add a parameter enter it in the <span class="ui">Parameter</span>
		combo box and click the <span class="ui">Add</span> button. The
		parameter now appears in the <span class="ui">All parameters</span> list
		box. (File parameters may include path macros).
	</p>

	<p>
		To edit an existing parameter, select it in the <span class="ui">All
		parameters</span> list box and click the <span class="ui">Edit</span>
		button (or double click the parameter). The parameter is copied to the
		<span class="ui">Parameters</span> combo box and can be edited there.
		The <span class="ui">Add</span> button's caption changes to
		<span class="ui">Update</span> and this is clicked to accept the edit
		and to update the selected parameter.
	</p>

	<p>
		Delete a parameter by selecting it in the <span class="ui">All
		parameters</span> list box and clicking the
		<span class="ui">Delete</span> button.
	</p>

	<p>
		Parameters can be re-ordered by selecting the parameter to be moved and
		changing its position in the list using the 
		<img src="../Images/upbtn.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:8px;vertical-align:middle;"
			alt="up button"
		> and
		<img src="../Images/downbtn.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:8px;vertical-align:middle;"
			alt="down button"
		> buttons. (Keyboard alternative: <span class="smallcaps">CTRL+UP</span>
		and <span class="smallcaps">CTRL+DOWN</span>).
	</p>

	<p>
		Ensure that no temporary file is included in a parameter of a program
		that is to be run by the uninstaller since the file will have been
		deleted by the installer. If this is the case then an error message
		(preceeded by a 
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:16px;vertical-align:bottom;"
			alt="bomb symbol"
		> symbol) will be displayed above the parameters list. Click the
		<a href="def-hottext.htm">hot link</a> contained in the message to get
		more information.
