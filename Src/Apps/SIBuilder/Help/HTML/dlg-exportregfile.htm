		Export Registry File Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This standard Windows save file dialog box appears when the
		<span class="ui">Export</span> button is clicked on the
		<a href="page-registry.htm">Registry page</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is used to name a registry file that is to be exported into the
		project. The type of export file should be selected in the
		<span class="ui">Save as type</span> drop down list.
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> can export files in
		<span class="prog">RegEdit</span> v4 or v5 format.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the name of an existing file is selected the user is invited to
		confirm that the file can be overwritten.
