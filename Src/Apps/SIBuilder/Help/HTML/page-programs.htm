	<h1>
		Programs Page
	</h1>

	<p>
		The installer and uninstaller are both able to run external programs*.
		These can either be programs known to be available on the target
		computer (e.g. <span class="prog">NotePad</span>) or programs that are
		included in the installation project. This facility enables the
		functionalilty of the installer to be extended by calling the external
		programs. Files required only by the installer can be deleted after they
		have been run. This page is used to determine which programs are run by
		the installer/uninstaller.
	</p>

	<p>
		The programs that are to be run are displayed in a tree, listed under
		the <span class="ui">Install Programs</span> and
		<span class="ui">Uninstall programs</span> nodes, depending on when the
		program is to be run. Programs that are included in the install project
		are indicated by icons according to their file type. External programs
		are indicated by a special exclamation icon, because their type is not
		known.
	</p>

	<p>
		Parameters that are to be passed to the program are listed under its
		entry in the tree and are preceeded by a diamond shaped icon.
	</p>

	<p>
		If there are any problems with a program or a parameter then its icon is
		replaced by a
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="vertical-align:bottom;width:16px;height:16px;">
		symbol and a clickable prompt appears under the page's buttons which
		leads to help on what may be wrong.
	</p>

	<p>
		Programs are updated by using the buttons on the right of the page, or
		by the equivalent items on the tree view's popup menu. The following
		commands are available:
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Add&nbsp;Program</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Adds a new program using the
				<a href="dlg-editprog.htm">Edit Program Details</a>
				dialog box. Whether the program defaults to running on
				installation or uninstallation depends which of these nodes has
				the current selection, but this can be changed in the dialog
				box.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Edit&nbsp;Program</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Edits details of the currently selected program using the
				<a href="dlg-editprog.htm">Edit Program Details</a>
				dialog box.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Delete&nbsp;Program</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Deletes the currently selected program.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span class="label">Delphi&nbsp;COM&nbsp;Apps</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Adds a special entry to both the Install and Uninstall nodes
				that will register a Delphi COM server program. The program is
				chosen using the
				<a href="dlg-comserverapp.htm">New Delphi COM Server
				Application</a> dialog box. The program specified should be a
				valid out of process COM server application that supports
				registration using the Delphi standard
				<span class="switch">/regserver</span> and
				<span class="switch">/unregserver</span> command line switches.
				The selected program is not checked for compliance. This command
				is disabled if there are no 32 bit applications in the project.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		* The installer can't associate documents with their registered
		applications so only executable files can be run. Any documents should
		be passed to applications as parameters.
