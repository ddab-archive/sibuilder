	<h1>
		Open Project Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This standard Windows dialog box is displayed when the
		<span class="menuref">File | Open</span> menu option is selected (or
		when the equivalent <a href="def-hottext.htm">hotlink</a> is clicked).
	</p>

	<p>
		The dialog is used to locate a <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> v2 or
		v3 (<span class="file">.sip</span>) or
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> v1 (<span class="file">.sib</span>)
		project file to be opened. 
	</p>

	<p>
		If a <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> v1 or v2 project file is opened
		then a new file name must be selected when the project is saved. This is
		because <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> v3 does not write
		<span class="file">.sib</span> or v2 <span class="file">.sip</span>
		files.
	</p>
