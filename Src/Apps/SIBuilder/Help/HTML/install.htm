	<h1>
		SIBuilder 3 Installation Information
	</h1>

	<h2>
		SIBuilder Files
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		A <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> installation comprises various
		files and sub-folders. The default installation is in
	</p>
	
	<p class="indent file">
		&lt;Program Files Folder&gt;\DelphiDabbler\SIBuilder3
	</p>
	
	<p>
		where <span class="file">&lt;Program Files Folder&gt;</span> is the
		default programs folder on your system (e.g.
		<span class="file">C:\Program Files</span>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Several of the files are essential to the correct operation of
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> and should not be deleted. A full
		list of files is provided in the file
		<span class="file">ReadMe.html</span> which can be found in the
		<span class="file">Docs</span> sub-folder of your
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> installation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> also stores its default project in
		the
	</p>
	
	<p class="indent file">
		&lt;Application Data&gt;\DelphiDabbler\SIBuilder3</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		folder, where <span class="file">&lt;Application Data&gt</span> is the
		per-user application data folder.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Registry Changes
	</h2>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> adds the following new registry
		keys:
	</p>
	
	<p class="indent file">
		HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DelphiDabbler\SITools\3.0\SIBuilder<br>
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\DelphiDabbler\SITools\3.0\SIBuilder
	</p>

	<h2>
		Uninstalling SIBuilder
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> should be uninstalled via the
		Control Panel using the Add/Remove programs applet.
	</p>

	<p>
		If <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> is uninstalled it is important to
		use the provided uninstall program. This will remove installation files
		and tidy up the registry. However
		<span class="file">UnInstall.exe</span> will remain in the root of your
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> installation. This is because the
		uninstaller can't delete its own file whilst executing. This file can
		safely be deleted manually as can the
		<span class="file">SIBuilder3</span> folder. The
		<span class="file">DelphiDabbler</span> folder can also be deleted if it
		is empty.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The uninstaller leaves the default project and the application data
		sub-directories on the system. They can be deleted manually.
	</p>
