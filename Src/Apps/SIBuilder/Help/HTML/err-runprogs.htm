	<h1>
		Program Errors
	</h1>

	<p>
		<span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> has detected one or more problems
		with the programs that have been set to run by the installer or
		uninstaller. These problems can be caused either by programs or their
		parameters. The offending items are marked with a 
		<img src="../Images/bomb.gif"
			style="width:16px;height:16px;vertical-align:middle;"
			alt="bomb symbol"
		> symbol in the tree view on the
		<a href="page-programs.htm">Programs page</a>.
		The likely causes of the problems, and solutions, are listed below.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Programs
	</h2>

	<p>
		There are two possible reasons why there is a problem with a program and
		both occur when the program has been set to run by the uninstaller:
	</p>
	
	<ol class="spaced lower-roman">
		<li>
			<div>
				The program file is to be installed from a temporary
				<a href="def-groups.htm">group</a>
				(and will therefore be deleted by the installer).
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<em>Solutions:</em>
				<ol class="unspaced lower-alpha no-para-space">
					<li>
						edit the program to make sure it is run only by the
						installer;
					</li>
					<li>
						install the program file into a different non-temporary
						group using the <a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div>
				The project does not include an uninstaller.
			</div>
			<div class="para-space">
				<em>Solution:</em> include an uninstall program in the project
				using the
				<a href="page-details.htm">Project Details page</a>.
			</div>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>
		Parameters
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		A parameter belongs to a program that is to be run by the uninstaller.
		The parameter references a file that will be installed from a temporary
		group.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<em>Solutions:</em>
	</p>

	<ol class="unspaced lower-alpha no-para-space">
		<li>
			change the program to run only from the installer;
		</li>
		<li>
			install the parameter file into a different non-temporary
			folder (using the
			<a href="page-files.htm">Files page</a>);
		</li>
		<li>
			edit the parameter to refer to a non-temporary file.
		</li>
	</ol>
