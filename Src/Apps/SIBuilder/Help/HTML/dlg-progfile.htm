		Choose Program File Dialog Box
	</h1>

	<p>
		This standard Windows dialog box appears when the
		<span class="ui">Browse for file...</span> item is selected from the
		<span class="ui">Program</span> combo box of the
		<a href="dlg-editprog.htm">Edit Program Details</a> dialog box. It is
		used to select a file to be run by the installer or uninstaller. Care
		should be taken to select only a program that will exist in the same or
		similar location on the target system.
	</p>

	<p>
		Choose the program you wish to specify in the edit box and click
		<span class="ui">OK</span>. Only <span class="file">.exe</span>,
		<span class="file">.bat</span> or <span class="ui">.com</span> files
		should be chosen.
