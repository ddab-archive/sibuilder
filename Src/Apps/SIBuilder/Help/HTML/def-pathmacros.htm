		About Path Macros
	</h1>

	<p>
		Path Macros enable paths to be specified in a system independent way.
		Path macros are predefined names that can appear at the start of a file
		path or file name specification. The macros that are supported are:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="spaced">
		<li>
			<kbd>[Install Path]</kbd> &ndash; this is replaced by the project's
			installation path (which may itself contain any of the other
			macros).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[Program Files]</kbd> &ndash; this is replaced by the
			Program Files folder (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Program
			Files</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[Common Files]</kbd> &ndash; this is replaced by the Common
			Files folder (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Program Files\Common
			Files</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[Windows]</kbd> &ndash; represents the Windows folder on the
			target system (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Windows</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[System]</kbd> &ndash; represents the System folder on the
			target system (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Windows\System</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[Temp]</kbd> &ndash; represents the user's temporary folder on
			the target system (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Windows\Temp</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[Desktop]</kbd> &ndash; represents the user's desktop directory
			on the target system (e.g. <span class="file">C:\Documents and
			Settings\<user-name>\Desktop</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[Programs Menu]</kbd> &ndash; represents the user's start menu
			program folder on the target system (e.g
			<span class="file">C:\Documents and Settings\<user-name>\Start
			Menu\Programs</span>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<kbd>[ScratchPad]</kbd> &ndash; represents a scratch pad folder
			available during installation only. This is a sub folder of
			<kbd>[Temp]</kbd> that has name defined by the installer and that is
			deleted once the installer completes. This path macro is used by the
			installer and users are recommended not to use it.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		When paths are entered in <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> that match
		any of the macros, <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> replaces the path
		with the macro.
	</p>

	<p>
		Path macros are expanded by the installation program. This means that
		you can be certain that files can be installed in any of these folders
		on the target system even if the actual folders are different to the
		system where <span class="prog">SIBuilder</span> created the project. If
		the project permits it, the person installing the program can specify
		their own value for the <kbd>[Install Path]</kbd> macro.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Note:</strong> You should not install any files into
		<kbd>[Temp]</kbd> or <kbd>[ScratchPad]</kbd> that must be available
		after the installer completes. The user may empty the <kbd>[Temp]</kbd>
		folder at any time and the installer will try to remove
		<kbd>[ScratchPad]</kbd> when it completes.
	</p>
