1. Overview and comments

For view this file better, open it with the WordPad.
If you modify the source or use this component set in a commercial product, please let me know.

This unit is similar to the zlib unit shipped with Delphi, but uses the better compression method available in the program bzip2.  Bzip2 is a compression program written by Julian Seward, for more information see http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2/index.html.

2. Installation

- The file makefile.bcb (usage: make -f makefile.bcb) can be used to recompile bzip2 using Borland C++ Builder.  After compilation, the object files in the subdirectory nostdio are for use with Delphi.

- Simply add to your Delphi project the file bzip2.pas.
